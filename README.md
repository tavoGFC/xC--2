Distributed shared memory (DSM) is an architecture where the physical memory of each  machine can be seen as one, at the time where a program tries to use the memory the systems  allocate a chunk of memory in any of the machines which form the DSM and a single machine can  address memory in any of the machines of the DSM. The main goal of this project is design and  implement a distributed shared memory manager at user level, using three levels of memory: Local  Memory, Remote Memory and Remote Storage. We are going to implement a few improvements to  C++ in order to make easier for the developer to use C++.
